# Crowdfunding_ETL

In this ETL mini project, I practised building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform data. After transforming the data, I created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, I uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
